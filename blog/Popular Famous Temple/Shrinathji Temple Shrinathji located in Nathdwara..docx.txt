24. .Provide Construction/  scientific  information about the  temple?
The Sri Kalahasteeswara Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva as the Vayu Linga representing the element air, is a marvel of Dravidian architecture with significant contributions from various dynasties, most notably the Chola and Vijayanagara empires. The temple's main gopuram and the hundred-pillared hall were constructed during the reign of Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara dynasty around 1516 AD. These structures are noted for their intricate carvings and artistic excellence.
The temple is uniquely constructed with the main sanctum facing west and the gopuram to the south. It incorporates a natural air vent that continuously blows air on the Vayu Linga, a distinctive feature that symbolizes the element of air. Additionally, the temple complex is adorned with various mandapas (halls), each supported by beautifully carved pillars depicting scenes from Hindu epics and puranic legends.
The temple has a rich tapestry of legends associated with it, including those of Rahu and Ketu, who are believed to have worshiped Lord Shiva here, granting the site an esteemed status for performing the Rahu Ketu Pooja to negate astrological doshas. The legend of Kannappa, a devoted hunter who was ready to offer his eyes to the linga, also adds to the temple's storied past.
25. . Is there any special significance attached to the temple -like for eg. Kasar Devi in Uttar khand- it is said-
“ The region surrounding the Kasar Devi Temple has an enormous geomagnetic field or Paramagnetism, thanks to gaps in bands of radiation. As a result, Kasar Devi is endowed with a cosmic energy similar to that of Stonehenge in UK and Machu Picchu in Peru.”
The Sri Kalahasteeswara Temple holds a unique spiritual significance due to its association with the element of air, or Vayu. It is one of the Pancha Bhoota Sthalams, which represent the five elements in nature. The temple's Vayu Lingam is particularly distinctive because it is swayed by a continuous natural air vent within the inner sanctum, a feature that underscores its connection to the element of air. This characteristic is believed to be a direct manifestation of the deity's presence and power.
Additionally, the temple is famous for its Rahu Ketu Pooja, believed to alleviate the astrological effects of Rahu and Ketu. According to legends, Rahu and Ketu, the celestial snake deities, worshipped Lord Shiva here to mitigate a curse, making the temple a crucial site for those seeking astrological remedies.
While the temple does not have a geomagnetic significance like Kasar Devi, its spiritual and astrological importance, combined with its architectural uniqueness, offers a profound experience, believed by many to be conducive to spiritual upliftment and astrological relief. The constant natural airflow through the Vayu Lingam is seen as a divine element, enhancing the temple’s spiritual atmosphere.
