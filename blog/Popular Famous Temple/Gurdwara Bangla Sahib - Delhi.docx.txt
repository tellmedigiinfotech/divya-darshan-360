19. What is the procedure for reporting items lost in a temple?
Procedure for Reporting Lost Items at Gurdwara Bangla Sahib:
Gurdwara Bangla Sahib, like many religious institutions, typically has a system in place to help visitors recover lost items. Here’s the general procedure you can follow if you find yourself in a situation where you've lost something at the Gurdwara:
1. Report to the Lost and Found Section:
   * Most gurdwaras have a designated "Lost and Found" area or office where lost items are kept. It is advisable to report the lost item as soon as possible to increase the chances of recovery.
   * Provide a detailed description of the lost item, including color, brand, type, and any distinctive features. This information can help the staff quickly identify if your item has been found.

20. If any one of the group members is missing, how to report and where to wait for? 
Reporting a Missing Group Member at Gurdwara Bangla Sahib:
If a group member goes missing while visiting Gurdwara Bangla Sahib, here’s a step-by-step guide on what to do:
1. Inform Gurdwara Security or Management:
   * Immediately report the missing person to the Gurdwara security staff or management. Provide them with a detailed description of the missing person, including their age, what they were wearing, and the last time and place they were seen.
2. Use Announcements:
   * Request the Gurdwara authorities to make an announcement over their public address system. This can be an effective way to locate a missing person quickly in a large and crowded place like Gurdwara Bangla Sahib.
3. Designate a Meeting Point:
   * Establish a common meeting point where your group can reconvene. This could be a prominent and easily recognizable location within the Gurdwara premises, such as near the entrance, by the Langar hall, or outside the main prayer hall.
   * Ensure all group members are aware of this meeting point in case someone gets separated.
4. Check with the Lost and Found Section:
   * Sometimes, especially in the case of young children, lost individuals are escorted to the Lost and Found section or the main office by good samaritans or Gurdwara staff. It’s a good idea to check there.
5. Stay Put and Wait:
   * Once you have reported the missing person and checked likely locations, it’s often best to stay put at your designated meeting point and wait. Moving around too much can make it harder to reconnect if the missing person is also trying to find you.

   * Make sure your mobile phone is handy and on loud if you’re waiting for a call from other group members or from the Gurdwara staff about the missing person.
7. Remain Calm and Patient:

Registration of Gurdwara Bangla Sahib:
Gurdwara Bangla Sahib, like most Sikh gurdwaras in India, is managed by a gurdwara committee rather than being directly registered under state government or district administration. Specifically, Gurdwara Bangla Sahib is managed by the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC). This committee is an autonomous organization that manages the gurdwaras in Delhi and is registered under the Societies Registration Act.
Details about the DSGMC:
* The DSGMC is elected by the local Sikh community and operates independently of direct government control, though it must comply with general laws applicable to religious and charitable organizations.
* The committee is responsible for the administration, maintenance, and various religious activities of the gurdwaras under its management.

At Gurdwara Bangla Sahib, and broadly in Sikh Gurdwaras, the philosophy and practice surrounding donations differ significantly from some practices observed in Hindu temples like Tirupati or Shirdi. Sikhism emphasizes selfless giving (seva) without expectation of material reward or privileges in return. Here’s how donations are typically viewed and managed:
1. Selfless Giving (Seva):
   * Donations made to Gurdwara Bangla Sahib are generally considered a form of seva or selfless service. The concept is rooted deeply in Sikh ethics, which advocate for contributing to the community and helping others without seeking personal benefits.
2. No Privileges or Benefits:
   * Unlike some religious donations where donors might receive direct benefits such as priority darshan, special entry tickets, or accommodation, Sikh Gurdwaras do not usually offer such privileges. All services like the Langar (community kitchen), access to prayers, or any other facilities are equally available to all, irrespective of one’s contribution.
3. Utilization of Donations:
   * Donations received by Gurdwara Bangla Sahib are typically used for:
      * Langar: Supporting the daily free meals served to thousands.
      * Educational and Healthcare Services: Funding schools, educational programs, and medical facilities that serve the community for free.
      * Maintenance and Development: Helping maintain and develop the Gurdwara’s infrastructure to better serve the community.
4. Recognition of Donors:
   * While material privileges are not offered, sometimes significant contributions are recognized through mentions in newsletters or plaques, especially for contributions towards infrastructure or large community projects. However, this is done more out of respect and acknowledgment rather than as an incentive for donations.
5. Voluntary Contributions:
   * Contributions are encouraged to be made voluntarily as part of one’s spiritual and moral duty. This fosters a spirit of equality and mutual respect among all who visit the Gurdwara.
In summary, at Gurdwara Bangla Sahib, the focus is on equality and providing selfless service, reflecting the core Sikh belief that everyone, regardless of their financial status or contributions, should have equal access to all religious services.

The Guru is revered for providing succor to the afflicted during this time.

      * High Flagpole (Nishan Sahib): Standing tall at the entrance, this flagpole is wrapped in a saffron-colored cloth with a Khanda (Sikh symbol) on top, representing the sovereignty of the Khalsa.
      * White Marble: The entire complex is constructed with white marble, which adds to its serene and sublime appearance.
3. Sarovar (Holy Pond):

25. . Is there any special significance attached to the temple -like for eg. Kasar Devi in Uttar khand- it is said-
“ The region surrounding the Kasar Devi Temple has an enormous geomagnetic field or Paramagnetism, thanks to gaps in bands of radiation. As a result, Kasar Devi is endowed with a cosmic energy similar to that of Stonehenge in UK and Machu Picchu in Peru.”
Special Significance of Gurdwara Bangla Sahib:
Gurdwara Bangla Sahib holds a profound spiritual significance rather than the type of geomagnetic or cosmic significance associated with places like Kasar Devi. Its importance is deeply rooted in Sikh history and the life of Guru Har Krishan, the eighth Sikh Guru. Here’s an outline of its special significance:
1. Association with Guru Har Krishan:
   * The Gurdwara was originally the bungalow of Raja Jai Singh of Amber and became historically significant when it served as a residence for Guru Har Krishan during his visit to Delhi in 1664. During an outbreak of cholera and smallpox, Guru Har Krishan helped the suffering by providing aid and fresh water from the well at this house, which earned him great reverence.
   * The well from which Guru Har Krishan drew water is considered to have healing properties and is now revered as a part of the Gurdwara complex.
2. The Healing Waters:
   * The Sarovar (holy pond) within the Gurdwara premises is believed to contain holy water with healing properties. This belief stems from the actions of Guru Har Krishan during the epidemic. Devotees often take home water from this sarovar, seeking blessings and cures for various ailments.
3. Symbol of Sikh Hospitality and Service:
   * Gurdwara Bangla Sahib is also renowned for its Langar service, a free community kitchen that serves thousands of meals daily to people of all religions, castes, and backgrounds. This service exemplifies the Sikh principles of Seva (selfless service) and equality.
4. Architectural and Spiritual Center:
   * The Gurdwara’s striking architecture with its golden dome and white marble walls serves not only as a place of worship but also as a spiritual beacon in the heart of India’s capital. It is a symbol of peace and spiritual refuge for many.
While Gurdwara Bangla Sahib does not have the same type of geomagnetic or cosmic attributes as places like Kasar Devi, its significance is deeply spiritual and humanitarian, making it a revered site in Sikhism and a place of universal appeal to people from all walks of life.

   * Seva, or selfless service, is a key component of Sikh spirituality. Visitors can participate in or observe various forms of Seva at the Gurdwara, such as helping in the Langar, cleaning the premises, or assisting in organizing books in the library. This practice is seen as a way to cultivate humility and connect with the divine.
3. Sarovar (Holy Pond):
   * The Sarovar at the Gurdwara is a large pool of water considered sacred. Pilgrims and visitors often walk around it or sit quietly by its side for contemplation and prayer. The calm and serenity of the Sarovar provide a space for introspection and spiritual rejuvenation.

Gurdwara Bangla Sahib is a place where these principles are palpable, from the architecture designed to welcome everyone equally to the teachings and hymns sung that often speak of social justice and the equality of humankind.
5. Meditation and Chanting:
   * The continuous reading of the Guru Granth Sahib (the holy scripture of Sikhism) and the musical hymns (Kirtan) provide a meditative experience. Visitors are welcome to sit, listen, and meditate in the main hall. The rhythmic and melodious recitations create a peaceful and contemplative environment conducive to spiritual growth.
6. Openness to All:
   * Regardless of one’s religious beliefs, Gurdwara Bangla Sahib is open to everyone. This openness reflects a core Sikh belief in the universal nature of spirituality – that all paths can lead to the divine, and all are welcome to seek it in their way at the Gurdwara.
