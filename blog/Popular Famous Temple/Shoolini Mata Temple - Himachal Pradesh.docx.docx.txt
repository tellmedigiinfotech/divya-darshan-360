The temple's architecture is relatively simple, featuring a dome-shaped roof and a white façade, which adds to its serene and sacred atmosphere​ (Wikipedia)​​ (Tour My India)​​ (Indian Holiday Trip)​.
Key Architectural and Historical Points:

* While the temple offers a spiritually enriching experience amidst the serene hills of Solan, there is no documented scientific evidence suggesting it has the same type of geomagnetic or cosmic properties as those more famously associated with other global spiritual sites. For visitors, its significance lies more in its religious heritage, architectural beauty, and the tranquil environment it provides for worship and reflection.
