25. . Is there any special significance attached to the temple -like for eg. Kasar Devi in Uttar khand- it is said-

The temple’s main structure, facing the Bada Danda (Grand Road), is believed to defy the gravitational pull of the Earth in certain ways.
4. Historical and Architectural Significance:
   * The temple is a prime example of Kalinga architecture and has intricate carvings and monumental structures.
