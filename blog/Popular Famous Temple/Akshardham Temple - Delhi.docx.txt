25. . Is there any special significance attached to the temple -like for eg. Kasar Devi in Uttar khand- it is said-
   * “ The region surrounding the Kasar Devi Temple has an enormous geomagnetic field or Paramagnetism, thanks to gaps in bands of radiation. As a result, Kasar Devi is endowed with a cosmic energy similar to that of Stonehenge in UK and Machu Picchu in Peru.”

   1. Sahaj Anand Water Show:
