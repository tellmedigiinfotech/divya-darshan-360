24. .Provide Construction/  scientific  information about the  temple 


The Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram is renowned not only for its spiritual significance but also for its architectural magnificence and historical importance. Here are some key aspects of its construction and architectural details:
1. Architectural Style: The temple is a splendid example of the Dravidian style of architecture, which is characterized by its towering gopurams (gateway towers) and intricate carvings. The temple's design includes high walls and a gopuram constructed in the Pandyan style, common in South Indian temple architecture.
2. Historical Construction: The temple's history and construction date back to the 8th century, but it has undergone several renovations and expansions over the centuries. The most significant renovations were undertaken during the reign of Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma in the 18th century, transforming it into the structure seen today.
3. Vimana and Sanctum: The temple's vimana (the tower above the main deity) is covered with gold-plated roofing, which adds to its grandeur. The sanctum sanctorum, where the deity reclines, is constructed from a single massive stone and is known for its mystical and spiritual aura.
4. Mural Paintings and Carvings: The temple walls are adorned with beautiful mural paintings and carvings that depict various scenes from Hindu mythology, particularly those associated with Lord Vishnu.
5. Ottakkal Mandapam: One of the unique architectural features of the temple is the Ottakkal Mandapam, which is a single slab of stone that forms the platform in front of the deity. This was commissioned by Marthanda Varma and is a remarkable example of stone craftsmanship.
6. The Vault: Below the temple are several vaults, which gained international attention when their treasures were discovered. These vaults, except for Vault B, have been opened and cataloged under the supervision of the Supreme Court of India, revealing a vast collection of gold, jewels, and other valuable artifacts.
The combination of its rich architectural design, historical treasures, and sacred importance makes the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple a fascinating subject for both devotees and historians alike. For more detailed scholarly analysis and images that capture the detailed craftsmanship, visiting dedicated cultural heritage or architectural websites would provide deeper insights.


25. . Is there any special significance attached to the temple -like for eg. Kasar Devi in Uttar khand- it is said-
“ The region surrounding the Kasar Devi Temple has an enormous geomagnetic field or Paramagnetism, thanks to gaps in bands of radiation. As a result, Kasar Devi is endowed with a cosmic energy similar to that of Stonehenge in UK and Machu Picchu in Peru.”
The Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple holds a special significance beyond its architectural and historical importance, primarily due to its spiritual and mythological connections.
1. Spiritual Epicenter: The temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, who is enshrined in the "Anantha Shayanam" posture, the eternal yogic sleep on the serpent Adi Shesha. This representation is highly significant in Hinduism, symbolizing the state of consciousness where Vishnu dreams the universe into reality.
2. Mystical Attributes: According to legend and religious belief, the temple is one of the seven Moksha Puris, or gateways to salvation, in India. Devotees believe that praying at this temple can lead to Moksha, the liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
3. Celestial Alignments: Like many ancient temples, the construction and orientation of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple align with specific astrological and cosmological beliefs. The temple architecture is said to harness spiritual energies, providing devotees a powerful place for meditation and prayer.
4. Historical Legends: The temple's vaults, especially the mysterious Vault B, which is yet to be opened, are believed to be protected by divine serpents and hold untold treasures. These legends add a layer of mystical significance to the temple, similar to narratives associated with other ancient religious sites worldwide.
While there is no scientifically documented geomagnetic field or paramagnetism as is mentioned with places like Kasar Devi, the Padmanabhaswamy Temple's aura and sanctity in Hindu mythology render it a site of immense spiritual power and allure. This makes it a place where many believe cosmic energies converge, similar to the spiritual significance of Stonehenge and Machu Picchu, albeit rooted in different cultural and mythological contexts.


26. Information which a foreigner would like to know- focussing more on spirituality rather than religion.
For a foreigner interested in the spiritual aspects of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple rather than its religious specifics, here are some points that might resonate with their search for a deeper understanding:

His reclining posture on the serpent Anantha is symbolic of calmness and patience in the face of the surrounding chaos of the universe, which can be a profound lesson in spiritual resilience.
3. Architectural Influence on Spirituality: The temple’s architecture itself, characterized by its gopuram (tower), intricate carvings, and layout, is designed to promote spiritual thoughts and feelings. The layout leads one progressively towards the sanctum, which can be seen as a metaphor for the journey of life leading to enlightenment or the ultimate truth.
4. Historical Continuity and Spiritual Legacy: The temple has been a continuous place of worship for centuries, providing a link between the past and present. This continuity is a testament to the enduring search for meaning and connection with the divine, which can be inspiring for those on their own spiritual journeys.

6. Sacred Rituals and Their Inner Meanings: The rituals performed in the temple, such as the offering of prayers and the elaborate pujas, while religious in form, can be understood in a spiritual context as methods to discipline the mind and focus one's energy towards the divine.
These aspects highlight the temple not just as a place of religious worship, but as a spiritual haven that offers peace, introspection, and a connection to the divine, transcending the confines of any single religion.
