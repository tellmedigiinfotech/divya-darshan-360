   * The temple's shikhara is adorned with sculptural finery, adding to its grandeur.

25. . Is there any special significance attached to the temple -like for eg. Kasar Devi in Uttar khand- it is said-
“ The region surrounding the Kasar Devi Temple has an enormous geomagnetic field or Paramagnetism, thanks to gaps in bands of radiation. As a result, Kasar Devi is endowed with a cosmic energy similar to that of Stonehenge in UK and Machu Picchu in Peru.”


The Danteshwari Temple in Dantewada, Chhattisgarh, holds significant religious and cultural importance, primarily due to its status as one of the 52 Shakti Peethas. These are sacred shrines dedicated to the goddess Shakti, the divine feminine power, and are spread across the Indian subcontinent. According to Hindu mythology, the Shakti Peethas were formed at sites where parts of the body of the goddess Sati fell after her self-immolation and the subsequent Tandava by Lord Shiva.
Special Significance of the Danteshwari Temple
1. Mythological Significance:
   * The temple is believed to be the spot where the tooth (danta) of Goddess Sati fell, giving the temple its name "Danteshwari" (Goddess with the Tooth). This connection to the Shakti Peethas makes it a vital pilgrimage site for devotees seeking the blessings of the divine mother.
2. Cultural Significance:
   * The Danteshwari Temple is deeply embedded in the local traditions and culture. It is a central part of the Bastar Dussehra festival, which is a unique 75-day-long celebration distinct from the Dussehra festivals held in other parts of India. During this festival, the idol of the goddess is taken out in elaborate processions, attracting thousands of tribal people from the surrounding regions.
3. Historical Significance:
   * Built in the 14th century by the Chalukya kings, the temple is a testament to the region's historical and architectural heritage. Its construction and continued importance reflect the enduring legacy of the Chalukya dynasty and the cultural continuity in the Bastar region.
4. Spiritual Energy:
   * While there is no specific mention of geomagnetic fields or cosmic energy similar to that of Kasar Devi Temple, the Danteshwari Temple is revered for its spiritual ambiance. The serene environment, combined with the rhythmic chanting of hymns and the presence of the divine idol, creates a profound spiritual experience for devotees.
Comparison to Kasar Devi Temple
Unlike the Kasar Devi Temple in Uttarakhand, which is noted for its geomagnetic field due to gaps in the bands of radiation, the Danteshwari Temple’s significance is more rooted in its mythological, cultural, and historical context. There are no widely known claims or studies attributing specific geomagnetic properties to the Danteshwari Temple similar to those of Stonehenge or Machu Picchu.
