* Timing: The event typically occurs once a month on the fourth day after the new moon (Krishna Paksha) and the fourth day after the full moon (Shukla Paksha), depending on the lunar calendar.
If you're planning a visit or want to participate in these monthly events, it's advisable to check the exact date each month as per the lunar calendar, as it shifts slightly each year. For the most accurate and detailed information, you might want to reach out directly to the temple's official contact or visit their website, especially if they offer online services like live darshan or event streaming for those unable to attend in person.
