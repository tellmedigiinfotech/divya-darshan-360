22. How can one make Donations , (apart from Hundi offerings in the temple) to whom and which bank account and for what all purposes?
It appears there are no direct search results providing donation details specifically for Girijatmaj Temple on Lenyadri Hill. To make donations other than through the temple's Hundi, I recommend contacting the temple directly through their official contact methods or visiting in person if possible.

24. .Provide Construction/  scientific  information about the  temple 
Girijatmaj Temple, situated on Lenyadri Hill in Pune District, is one of the unique Ashtavinayak temples dedicated to Lord Ganesha. Here's a closer look at its construction and scientific aspects:
Construction Features:
1. Location and Layout: The temple is carved into a rocky cliff of Lenyadri Hill, which is part of the Western Ghats. It is located approximately 90 feet above the ground level, requiring visitors to climb 307 steps to reach the temple. This location provides not only a strategic vantage point but also a serene ambiance ideal for a spiritual retreat.
2. Rock-Cut Architecture: The most striking feature of Girijatmaj Temple is its setting in a single long hall, which is a rock-cut cave. This hall is approximately 53 feet long and encompasses 18 smaller chambers, with the idol of Lord Ganesha set against the back wall. The cave temple is believed to be carved out during the 1st and 3rd century AD, showing the architectural brilliance of ancient Indian artisans.
3. Design: Unlike many traditional temples, there are no supporting pillars within the main hall, which is an unusual feature in rock-cut architecture. The temple's layout and structure utilize the natural form of the cave, which has been minimally altered to suit religious purposes.
Scientific Insights:
1. Temperature Regulation: The rock-cut structure of the temple offers natural insulation. The interior remains relatively cool during summers and warm during winters, providing a comfortable environment for worshippers throughout the year.
2. Acoustics: The cave’s design also influences its acoustics. Chants and prayers resonate within the hall, enhancing the spiritual atmosphere.
3. Sustainability: The temple’s construction technique reflects an ancient understanding of sustainable architecture. Utilizing the natural landscape without extensive modification has minimized environmental impact, preserving the hill’s ecology and the surrounding landscape’s natural beauty.


25. . Is there any special significance attached to the temple -like for eg. Kasar Devi in Uttar khand- it is said-
“ The region surrounding the Kasar Devi Temple has an enormous geomagnetic field or Paramagnetism, thanks to gaps in bands of radiation. As a result, Kasar Devi is endowed with a cosmic energy similar to that of Stonehenge in UK and Machu Picchu in Peru.”
Girijatmaj Temple on Lenyadri Hill holds special significance in several respects, combining religious, historical, and natural aspects:
Religious Significance:
1. One of the Ashtavinayak: Girijatmaj Temple is one of the eight revered temples in the Ashtavinayak circuit dedicated to Lord Ganesha in Maharashtra. Each temple in this circuit has a distinct form of Ganesha idol and associated legends that highlight different aspects of the deity.
2. Ganesha's Childhood: The temple is believed to be the site where Goddess Parvati performed penance to have Ganesha as her child. The idol here faces north, which is considered unique, and is believed to be self-manifested (Swayambhu). This adds a significant spiritual dimension as devotees consider it a place where Ganesha spent his childhood.
Historical Significance:
1. Ancient Trade Route: The location of Lenyadri Hill was significant in ancient times as it was situated along an important trade route. This added to the strategic importance of the temple as a spiritual stopover for travelers and traders.
Natural Significance:
1. Ecological Importance: The temple is situated in the Western Ghats, a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its rich biodiversity. The natural surroundings and the relatively unaltered condition of the temple offer a unique blend of spirituality and nature conservation.
2. Geomagnetic Qualities: While there isn't a widely recognized scientific claim similar to that of Kasar Devi regarding geomagnetic fields, the natural setting of the Girijatmaj Temple on a hill surrounded by rock formations could contribute to a unique energy environment. Natural settings like these are often considered to have higher vibrational energies due to their pristine condition and the ancient, undisturbed rock structures.
Thus, while not explicitly noted for geomagnetic uniqueness like Kasar Devi, Girijatmaj Temple's location and spiritual lore contribute to its special significance, making it a revered site for pilgrims and nature enthusiasts alike.

At the Girijatmaj Temple, along with the annual celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi, there are regular monthly events that draw devotees to participate in communal and spiritual activities. A significant monthly event at many Ganesha temples, including Girijatmaj, is the celebration of Sankashti Chaturthi.

Description of the Event:
* Rituals and Practices: On Sankashti Chaturthi, devotees observe a strict fast from sunrise to moonrise. The fast is broken only after sighting the moon and performing puja and moon worship.

The observance of Sankashti Chaturthi brings a recurring opportunity for spiritual renewal and communal bonding every month. Devotees believe that by observing this fast and participating in the rituals, Lord Ganesha will remove obstacles from their lives and bless them with success and prosperity.
For those interested in visiting the Girijatmaj Temple during these monthly events, it is recommended to check the Hindu lunar calendar for the specific dates each month, as they change according to the moon's cycles.
